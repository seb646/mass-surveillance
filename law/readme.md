# Legislation
There is no one law that solely authorizes mass surveillance programs, including those that incidentially collect information on U.S. citizens. Instead, the government operates mass surveillance programs by weaving together different laws and precedents.

## Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
The first piece of the puzzle is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allows the U.S. government to conduct suveillance of foreign powers, and those associatd with foreign powers. This act also established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), responsible for approving new surveillance programs and providing oversight for current programs.

## Unitary Executive Theory
The theory of a Unitary Executive posits that the President holds full executive power over the United States government. Through executive actions, such as Executive Order 12333, the executive branch can authorize and create a structure for surveillance programs that do not carry the same limitations as those created under FISA. The theory can also allow the President to utilize the military to conduct surveillance, even on domestic targets.
