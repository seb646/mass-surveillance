# Surveillance Programs
Mass surveillance in the United States occurs across several agencies, with broad mandates that infringe upon the rights of U.S. citizens and often produce little to no meaningful results. Most of the United States’ digital, or signals, surveillance operates through programs under the National Security Agency (NSA), with other agencies utilizing the data collected by the NSA’s programs. E

dward Snowden’s leaked documents in 2013 highlight a number of surveillance programs operated by the NSA, however, it is impossible to know how these programs have grown or if new programs were created over the past eight years. In no particular order, the NSA’s known surveillance programs and databases are XKeyScore, PRISM, MYSTIC, FASCIA, and ECHELON. 

## The NSA's Programs
XKeyScore, PRISM, MYSTIC, and FASCIA all have one common thread: they collect mass sums of information only to use a small fraction of that information. Although the NSA has no direct use for everything collected by their programs, other agencies, like the FBI, can also use the information in their investigations. It is important to note that the mandate given to several of these programs specifies that the information can only be used for foreign targets. 

Despite this fact, the government operates under the guise of “incidental” collection as an excuse for monitoring and retaining the data of U.S. citizens. General Keith Alexander, the Director of the National Security Agency from 2005-2014, testified before Congress in defense of programmatic surveillance, stating that “the information gathered from these programs provided the U.S. government with critical leads to help prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world.” 

While the government continues to insist that programmatic surveillance assists law enforcement officials in preventing terrorist attacks, a 2014 study by the New America Foundation, which analyzed 225 individuals linked to forign terrorist groups and charged with an act of terrorism in the United States, found that “traditional methods of investigation...provided the impetus for investigations in the majority of cases” (Bergen 2014, 1). The study showed that the collection of telephone metadata assisted in 1.8% of cases, while NSA surveillance of persons outside the U.S. assisted in 4.4% of cases (2). The study concluded that “surveillance of American phone metadata has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terroristrelated activity” (2). 

The study proves that the NSA’s programs are not necessary for preventing the majority of terrorist attacks. Further, U.S. citizens should not have to sacrifice their rights to privacy and protections from unlawful searches and seizures in exchange for security – but the government has not given citizens the choice.
