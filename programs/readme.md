# Surveillance Programs
Mass surveillance in the United States occurs across several agencies, with broad mandates that infringe upon the rights of U.S. citizens and often produce little to no meaningful results. Most of the United States’ digital, or signals, surveillance operates through programs under the National Security Agency (NSA), with other agencies utilizing the data collected by the NSA’s programs. Edward Snowden’s leaked documents in 2013 highlight a number of surveillance programs operated by the NSA, however, it is impossible to know how these programs have grown or if new programs were created over the past eight years. In no particular order, the NSA’s known surveillance programs and databases are XKeyScore, PRISM, MYSTIC, FASCIA, and ECHELON.
